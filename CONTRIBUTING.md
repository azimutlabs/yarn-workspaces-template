# üë©‚Äçüíª Contributing
Thanks for contributing to the project!
Here you can find the instruction about everything you need to properly contribute
to the project. We describe package creation, compilation, testing, linting and history management.

## üß∞ Prerequisite
The only prerequisite we have is that you have your global [`Yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com)
keep up to date and updated to the latest, which is "Classic" `1.*` version.

Preferred Node.js version is the latest LTS because CI tests will only be running on that versions.

## üìú Git Commits
Commit messages MUST fallow [**Conventional Commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification, so [**Lerna**](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) could properly determine the correct
[**version bump**](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/main/commands/version#--conventional-commits).

[**Husky**](https://github.com/typicode/husky) git hook manager is executed on pre-commit and
message is validated using [**commitlint**](https://commitlint.js.org) to ensure that commit
fallows the basis of conventional commits.

## üì¶ Packages
To make the package part of the workspace, you should locate it under the [**packages**](packages) directory.
The structure of a single package should be typically made as shown by the layout below:
```shell
${package}/
  bin/     # package provided binaries if there is any
  example/ # usage example
  lib/     # compilation output
  src/     # source code
  test/    # unit tests

  package.json    # contains all the necessary configurations for `babel`, `browserlist`, and more
  rollup.config.js # rollup is used for bundling the output `lib` directory
  tsconfig.json    # must extend the root config and set the context to the `src` directory
```

Every `package.json` should have the fallowing scripts:
+ `start` - starts the development of a package
+ `compile` - compiles the production-ready bundle

There is a clear example of a correctly made package named `sum` [**here**](packages/sum).
You should use it as the boilerplate for your next packages as it already contains everything
you will typically need in a package.

## üèóÔ∏è Development
Code bundling is done by [**Rollup**](https://rollupjs.org) and configured by our
[configuration libraries](https://github.com/azimutlabs/rollup). Scripts that were described before
in the **Packages** section are aliased at the root of the Mono-repository, but now they
`compile` or `start` the development process not only for one package but for the whole project.

It is recommended to use the root scripts instead of single package scripts to speed up the
development. Example of the usage:
```shell
$ yarn start
```

## ‚ú® Linting
Code style is fully controlled by [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org) and configured by our
[configuration libraries](https://github.com/azimutlabs/eslint).
We highly encourage that your IDE is integrated with the linter and could auto-fix the problems
if they ever appear.

If [**git hook manager**](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is installed correctly, we provide
commit message linting controlled by [**commitlint**](https://commitlint.js.org) configured
by the rules of [**conventional commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification.

You can trigger the linter to lint the `packages` directory manually by executing the `lint` script
at the root of the project.
Example of usage:
```shell
$ yarn lint # append `--fix` option to auto-fix the warnings
```

## ‚úîÔ∏è Testing
Unit testing is done by [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io) and configured by
[**ts-jest**](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest) preset. The placement of unit tests is described
in the **Packages** section.

Start the testing by executing the `test` script at the root of the project. Example of usage:
```shell
$ yarn test # append `--watchAll` option to start Jest in watch mode
```
